  abstract = {Summary: The fundamental problem of gene selection via cDNA data is
	to identify which genes are differentially expressed across different
	kinds of tissue samples (e.g. normal and cancer). cDNA data contain
	large number of variables (genes) and usually the sample size is
	relatively small so the selection process can be unstable. Therefore,
	models which incorporate sparsity in terms of variables (genes) are
	desirable for this kind of problem. This paper proposes a two-level
	hierarchical Bayesian model for variable selection which assumes
	a prior that favors sparseness. We adopt a Markov chain Monte Carlo
	(MCMC) based computation technique to simulate the parameters from
	the posteriors. The method is applied to leukemia data from a previous
	study and a published dataset on breast cancer.Supplementary information:

	to a discrete-time discrete-state Markov process with the transition
	probabilities constrained so that the state variable can either stay

	exactly reproduces the change point model. The model is estimated
	by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using an approach that is based
	on Chib (1996). This methodology is quite valuable since it allows
	for the fitting of more complex change point models than was possible

  title = {Adaptive Sparseness for Supervised Learning},

  volume = {25},
  pages = {1150--1159},
  abstract = {The goal of supervised learning is to infer a functional mapping based
	on a set of training examples. To achieve good generalization, it
	is necessary to control the "complexity" of the learned function.
	In Bayesian approaches, this is done by adopting a prior for the
	parameters of the function being learned. We propose a Bayesian approach
	to supervised learning, which leads to sparse solutions; that is,
	in which irrelevant parameters are automatically set exactly to zero.
	Other ways to obtain sparse classifiers (such as Laplacian priors,
	support vector machines) involve (hyper)parameters which control
	the degree of sparseness of the resulting classifiers; these parameters
	have to be somehow adjusted/estimated from the training data. In
	contrast, our approach does not involve any (hyper)parameters to
	be adjusted or estimated. This is achieved by a hierarchical-Bayes
	interpretation of the Laplacian prior, which is then modified by
	the adoption of a Jeffreys' noninformative hyperprior. Implementation
	is carried out by an expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm. Experiments
	with several benchmark data sets show that the proposed approach
	yields state-of-the-art performance. In particular, our method outperforms
	SVMs and performs competitively with the best alternative techniques,
	although it involves no tuning or adjustment of sparseness-controlling

  abstract = { The Lasso estimate for linear regression parameters can be interpreted
	as a Bayesian posterior mode estimate when the regression parameters
	have independent Laplace (i.e., double-exponential) priors. Gibbs
	sampling from this posterior is possible using an expanded hierarchy
	with conjugate normal priors for the regression parameters and independent
	exponential priors on their variances. A connection with the inverse-Gaussian
	distribution provides tractable full conditional distributions. The
	Bayesian Lasso provides interval estimates (Bayesian credible intervals)
	that can guide variable selection. Moreover, the structure of the
	hierarchical model provides both Bayesian and likelihood methods
	for selecting the Lasso parameter. Slight modifications lead to Bayesian
	versions of other Lasso-related estimation methods, including bridge
	regression and a robust variant. },

  abstract = {This paper introduces a general Bayesian framework for obtaining sparse
	solutions to regression and classification tasks utilising models
	linear in the parameters. Although this framework is fully general,
	we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that
	we denote the 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), a model of identical
	functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art 'support vector
	machine' (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic
	Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models
	which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a
	comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages.
	These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic
	estimation of 'nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise
	arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-'Mercer' kernels). We detail
	the Bayesian framework and associated learning algorithm for the
	RVM, and give some illustrative examples of its application along
	with some comparative benchmarks. We offer some explanation for the
	exceptional degree of sparsity obtained, and discuss and demonstrate
	some of the advantageous features, and potential extensions, of Bayesian
	relevance learning.},
