  abstract = {This article demonstrates the difficulty that traditional outlier
	detection methods, such as that of Tsay, have in identifying level
	shifts in time series. Initializing the outlier/level-shift search
	with an estimated autoregressive moving average model lowers the
	power of the level-shift detection statistics. Furthermore, the rule
	employed by these methods for distinguishing between level shifts
	and innovation outliers does not work well in the presence of level
	shifts. A simple modification to Tsay's procedure is proposed that
	improves the ability to correctly identify level shifts. This modification
	is relatively easy to implement and appears to be quite effective
	in practice.},

  abstract = {Theory: We argue that levels of concurrence and dissent on the U.S.
	Supreme Court are functions of "consensual norms." These norms arise
	from, and are influenced by, the behaviors of the individual justices,
	including the actions of the chief justices. In turn, they cause
	concurrences and dissents to fluctuate around a common level. Hypotheses:
	If consensual norms are a substantial influence on the behavior of
	the Court, the long-run extent of concurrence and dissent on the
	Court will covary substantially, and will do so to varying degrees
	under different chief justices. Methods: To test our hypotheses,
	we use cointegration and error-correction analyses of the number
	of Supreme Court cases from 1800 to 1991 with concurring and dissenting
	opinions. Because of the dramatic increase in concurrences and dissents
	during the 1940s, we make use of recently-developed methods for detecting
	cointegrating relationships in the presence of structural breaks.
	Results: Consistent with our expectations, dissents and concurrences
	move together over time; thus consensual norms appear to influence
	substantially both concurrences and dissents on the Court. The effects
	of such norms vary in the long term under different Chief Justices.},

	inference on a linear state space model with errors that are a mixture
	of normals and coefficients that can switch over time. Our approach
	simultaneously generates the whole of the state vector given the
	mixture and coefficient indicator variables and simultaneously generates
	all the indicator variables conditional on the state vectors. The
	states are generated efficiently using the Kalman filter. We illustrate
	our approach by several examples and empirically compare its performance
	to another Gibbs sampler where the states are generated one at a
	time. The empirical results suggest that our approach is both practical
	to implement and dominates the Gibbs sampler that generates the states
	one at a time.},

	and intervention variables for the univariate and multivariate analysis

	for the computation of different estimates for the unobserved state

	for the other parameters in the model are also considered. Next,
	we discuss how the estimation procedures can be used for constructing
	confidence intervals, detecting outlier observations and structural
	breaks, and testing model assumptions of residual independence, homoscedasticity,
	and normality. We then show how ARIMA and ARIMA components models
	fit in the state space framework to time series analysis. We also

	we generalize the half-Cauchy prior to the wider class of hypergeometric

	and marginal densities when these priors are used for a top-level
	normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. We go on to prove
	a proposition that, together with the results for moments and marginals,
	allows us to characterize the frequentist risk of the Bayes estimators
	under all global-shrinkage priors in the class. These results, in
	turn, allow us to study the frequentist properties of the half-Cauchy
	prior versus a wide class of alternatives. The half-Cauchy occupies
	a sensible middle ground within this class: it performs well near
	the origin, but does not lead to drastic compromises in other parts
	of the parameter space. This provides an alternative, classical justication
	for the routine use of this prior. We also consider situations where
	the underlying mean vector is sparse, where we argue that the usual
	conjugate choice of an inverse-gamma prior is particularly inappropriate,
	and can severely distort inference. Finally, we summarize some open
	issues in the specication of default priors for scale terms in hierarchical
	models},

	1997-2001 and 2001-2005, along with commensurate constituency controls,
	we thus show that mps' popular- ity is indeed effected by their legislative
	activity in small but significant ways. in particular, government-party
	voters demand unity on votes that are key parts of the government's
